# ECE DEVOPS Project

This is the DevOps project. It shows the different tools we learned during the semester but applied on one single web application.

## Work performed

### 1. Creation of a web application

  First, we created a web application using **NodeJS**. We configured the server and the application to run on the **port 3000**.

  For the database, we used **Redis**. The [routes](./src/routes) and [controllers](./src/controllers) folders allow us to do some changes on the user in the database. Controller is call when it receives some routes and data.

  Then, we covered the application with tests of different levels. The application is covered by **12 tests** :

- 2 for the configuration
- 1 for the Redis connection
- 5 for the user (CRUD methods)
- 4 for the user REST API

### 2. Application of CI/CD pipeline

  We chose to apply the CI/CD pipeline using Azure. The configuration file for this is [main.yml](/.github/workflows/main_project-devops-saint-chopin.yml)

- Continuous integration

  First, we applied continuous integration using **GitHub Actions**. This action allowed us to bring automation. To do this, we created a CI workflow. It can be found in the file [main.yml](/.github/workflows/main_project-devops-saint-chopin.yml), where you can find the actions configuration.

  !CI](./Assets/CI.png)

- Continuous deployment

  To apply continuous deployment, we used **Azure**. We have configured the workflow to deploy it. On this screen, we can see that the application is deployed and linked to **GitHub** actions.
  Before doing our deployment on azure we used to deploy on **Heroku** but this platform became paid on November 28th.
  We did this deployment with this file [main.yml](/learn-github-actions.yml)

  As you can see, the web application is deployed on **Azure** and visible at <https://project-devops-saint-chopin.azurewebsites.net/>.

### 3. Configure and provision a virtual environment and run your application using the IaC approach

- Vagrant
  In order to configure a VM with Vagrant, we created a [Vagrantfile](./Vagrantfile). Th VM is running on **CentOs/7**.

  We provisioned the VM with Ansible using **Ansible** playbook inside [run.yml](.playbooks/run.yml).

  Then, we configured a role to install Redis, Node and npm inside [main.yml](.playbooks/roles/projet/install/tasks/main.yml).

  You can run `vagrant up` to bring the VM up with VirtualBox. Then, `vagrant ssh` to go inside the VM.

  `Redis` is correctly installed :

  ![redis](./Assets/redis.png)

  `Node` is correctly installed :

  ![node](./Assets/node.png)

- Health checks

  For the health checks, we are in the vm. The files are copied into the opt file. This copy is used to run our application and to make the health checks. We make the command cd /opt/vagrant.

  ![opt](./Assets/opt.png)

  After having installed node the npm command should be known however it does not work. So we have to install it by hand with `sudo yum install npm nodejs`.

  Then we can launch our application by doing npm install and npm run.
  However when we use npm install an error occurs. We aren't able to launch the code and especially to make the health checks with the routes created speciphysically for them.

### 4. Build Docker image of your application

To build the docker image, we used the command `docker build -t devopsproject .`. This is the result on Docker Desktop using the image pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hbeheray/devopsproject/general) :

![image-20211129232311108](./images/dockerimage.JPG)

### 5. Make container orchestration using Docker Compose

For this step, we created a [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) containing Redis and the web application at the root of the project and ran it with `docker-compose up`. This allowed us to run the project with this container.

![containers](./images/containers.JPG)

The web application is accessible from here : <http://localhost:6500/>.



### 6. Make docker orchestration using Kubernetes

First of all, we used `minikube start` to install Kubernetes cluster using **Minikube**. Then we created two deployments : [redis-deployment.yaml](/k8s/redis-deployment.yaml) and [`web-deployment.yaml`](/k8s/web-deployment.yaml).

After creating these 2 deployments, we created two services : [`redis-service.yaml`](/k8s/redis-service.yaml) and [`web-service.yaml`](/k8s/web-service.yaml).

Finally, we created [`redisvolume-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml`](/k8s/redisvolume-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml).

Then, we applied the configuration using `kubectl apply -f .` to apply all configuration files.

After that, we were able to access the service by doing `minikube service web` and the result was the following screen :

![web-service](./images/web-service.png)

The web application is accessible at <http://127.0.0.1:55441>.



### 7. Make a service mesh using Istio

#### 1. Deploy your application using Istio

First of all, we checked the default labels by running `kubectl get ns default --show-labels`. Then, we enabled the namespace **istio injection** by running `kubectl namespace default istio-injection = enabled` in order to inject the proxy containers inside the pods.

![istioinjection](./images/istioinjection.jpg)

Then, we ran `kubectl apply -f .` in [`k8s`](/k8s) folder to create the deployment, pods and services for the web application in Kubernetes.

![kubecltapply](./images/kubecltapply.png)

As you can see on the screen, there are 2 containers per pod because the proxies have been injected.

The web service is accessible by running `minikube service web`.

![istiowebservice](./images/istiowebservice.png)

It automatically opens a web application on the browser.

When we go to postman and try to post a user and after get it, it works.
![postman2](./images/postman2.png)

![postman1](./images/postman1.png)



### 8. Implement Monitoring to your containerized application

In order to install **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to the k8s cluster, we took the configuration files given in the Istio installation inside `samples/addons/grafana.yaml` and `samples/addons/prometheus.yaml`. We copied them to the project. You can find them [here](./k8s/monitoring).

Then, we ran `kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml` and `kubectl apply -f grafana.yaml` to install **prometheus** and **grafana** to the kubernetes cluster.

![istiodeployment](./images/istio_deployment.png)

By running `kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus -n istio-system 9090` we can go to <http://localhost:9090> to display the prometheus homepage. We can run queries and see status as you can see on the 3 screens below.

![kubernetes1](./images/kubernetes2.png)
![kubernetes2](./images/kubernetes3.png)
![prometheus](./images/prometheus.png)

By running `kubectl port-forward svc/grafana -n istio-system 3000` we can go to <http://localhost:3000> to display the grafana homepage.

We can go to the Istio service dashboard to display some graphs about the web service. Each time we do a request on the web application, it appears on this dashboard (as presented on the screens below).

![grafana1](./images/grafana1.png)
![grafana2](./images/grafana2.png)
![grafana3](./images/grafana3.png)

Grafana also displays the ressource usage of the service.

## Bonus

### 1. Swagger-UI

We used **Swagger-ui** to document our API. It is available at <http://localhost:3000/api-docs>.

![swagger1](./images/swagger1.png)

We created :

- Documentation for the user object

  ![swagger2](./images/swagger2.png)

- Documentation for the POST method

  ![swagger3](./images/swagger3.png)

- Documentation for the GET method

  ![swagger4](./images/swagger4.png)

- Documentation for the PUT method

  ![swagger5](./images/swagger5.png)
  ![swagger6](./images/swagger6.png)

- Documentation for the DELETE method

  ![swagger7](./images/swagger7.png)

## Instructions

### Install

In order to install all the dependencies you can run `npm install`. To run the web application locally you also need to [install redis](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-devops-2021-fall/blob/master/courses/devops/modules/04.continuous-testing/lab.md#before-starting).

Or you can just use docker and pull redis image from docker hub using `docker pull redis` and run it using `sudo docker run --name my-first-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis`.

### Use

- Check that all test are passing using `npm test`.

- Run `npm start` in your terminal.

- Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.

### Test

In order to run test you can run `npm test`. There are 20 tests which should all pass, if they don't verify that redis is running.
